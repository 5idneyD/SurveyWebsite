# SurveyHeaven.co.uk

Hey, I'm making a website where users can create their own surveys.
Similar to Survey Monkey only everything is free (and better).
As many questions, answers and surveys as you want, all for free.

Looking to implement databases for practice and using git for the first time. Learning new JS frameworks as well.

Thanks for reading.
